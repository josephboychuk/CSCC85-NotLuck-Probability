% Simple Controllers
%
%  Suppose we have managed to land a nice all-terrain
% rover on Mars - we're very proud of it, it can 
% actually go pretty fast and we plan to use it to
% drive around collecting dust (lifted by the front
% wheels and sucked into mass spectrometers for
% analysis). 
%
%  In order for the rover to accomplish its mission,
% it's essential that it drive around Mars at a 
% constant speed. We need a constant speed because
% the soil analysis uses density and particle size
% as part of the process of determining soil
% composition, and these are affected by driving 
% speed.
%
% Your task here is to implement a
% very simple controller that will allow the rover
% to achieve a speed that is as near to constant as
% possible, in the presence of external forces that
% affect the rover's driving.
%
% Your task is to:
%
% a) Understand the problem at hand and the forces
%    that affect how the rover drives
% b) Implement a simple, carefully calibrated PID
%    controller to quickly and smoothly correct for
%    any deviations from the target speed, so as to
%    keep the rover moving at a near-constant pace.
% c) Test your controller under different conditions
%    and see how it behaves.

%                ------------------------------------------(1,1)
%               
%   INPUT PARMS:
% - Tgt_speed - target rover speed in m/s
% - Rover_mass - self explanatory. In kg
% - delta_t - maximum change in rover direction per unit of time, in radians
% - max_torque - maximum torque produced by the rover's engine assembly, also
%                used for braking.
% - Kp, Ki, Kd - Constants for the proportional, integral and differential
%                terms in your PID controller. You'll need to tune these!
%
%  Now for a bit of physics (which I just looked up, highschool was a long
%  time ago! let me know if you find an error in my setup below!)
%
%    - Given your control input U in [-1,1], the torque requested on the
%      wheels of the rover is:
%
%      t=U*max_torque;      % Torque is in units of N.m (Newton meters)
%
%    - Given t, we find the force acting on the rover (either to accelerate
%      or brake) by dividing the torque by the radius of the wheels.
%      The Mars sojourner rover had a wheel diameter of 13 cm, let's go with
%      that:
%
%      F=t/.065;        % Radius in meters, so Force is now in Newtons (kg*m/s^2)
%
%      ** CAVEAT: Torque is not infinite! the amount of force put out by the
%                 engine decreases very fast as we approach the rover's top
%                 speed of 25m/s. You can't accelerate endlessly!
%
%    - Acceleration is obtained by Newton's 2nd law :)
%
%      a=F/Rover_mass;  % Mass is in kg, which leaves acceleration in m/s^2
%
%      ** HOWEVER - Note that the rover is moving in 3D, so we actually need
%                   an acceleration vector. 
%                   The above equations are scalar, we will use vector forms
%                   for everything below - Force will be a vector in 3D,
%                   yielding a 3D vector for acceleration, which gives a
%                   3D vector for velocity, which gives a 3D vector for 
%                   position over time.
%
%    - External forces - Obtained from the rover's mass and the gravity on
%                        Mars surface - The rover's weight causes a force
%                        always pointing down. We'll figure out what 
%                        the contribution of this force is in the direction
%                        of motion to determine the required acceleration
%
%      The basic computation looks like so (in scalar form)
%
%      Ext=Rover_mass*Mars_gravity;     
%
%      Rover mass is in kg, Mars gravity is 3.721 m/s^2, which gives units
%      of m*kg/m^2 -> Newtons again! We should always make sure units are
%      consistent in our operations, this gives us some certainty we're
%      doing the right thing.
%
%      ** Final notes : Your control input U does NOT take effect instantly. Like any
%      ** real system there is lag. The simulation will account for that.
%
%      ** Because velocity is a vector, your target speed is in terms of the
%      ** magnitude of the velocity vector.
%
%      ** The simulation reports the RMS (Root-Mean-Square) error of the
%      ** Rover's actual velocity compared to the target, over the last
%      ** 25 simulation steps. Your goal is to get this as close to 0
%      ** as possible for a sustained amount of time. 
%      ** RMS < .5 is pretty ok, .3 < RMS < .5 is good, less than that is
%      ** very good!
%
%      ** Your controller should work for different settings (rover mass,
%      ** max torque, etc.) and on different locations (more or less hilly)
%
%    You don't need to use any of that! (your controller only cares about
%    applying a control input in [-1,1]). I'm just showing you so you know
%    what the simulation is doing.
%
%    ***** THE SCALE OF THE ROVER'S MOTION IS UNREALISTIC - NOT TO SCALE ******
%    ***** Mars is a BIG planet, if we made it proportional, we'd have to *****
%    ***** wait for hours or days to see the rover move on this map! **********
%    ***** I've set the arbitrary scale so a velocity of 10m/s is equivalent **
