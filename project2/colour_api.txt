// Colour sensor api for project 3

// Read the color sensor and return the colour it read as an index
// Detect colour sensor failure and inform the user like return -2
// If detecting an unexpected colour, return -1
// Automatically deal with noise in the reading ?
int read_colour();
// call colour sensor
// obtains RGB
// take difference from all reference values and pick

// colour boundary cases; tune it so the colour returned behaves like this
// road / inter -> inter
// road / off road (white or building) -> off road
// road / boundary -> boundary
// building / boundary -> boundary
// inter / building -> inter

// consider doing multiple readings and take average to
// use. gotta consider if there will be too much lag in the readings

// todo also implement a RGB to HSV function
// then we can compare the performance of those 2
