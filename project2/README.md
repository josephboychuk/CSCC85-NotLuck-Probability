# About this branch merge-colour
This contains the updated code for the colour sensor and logic to convert
RGB values to a colour. The code on dev, at time of this writing, uses indexed
colour mode on the EV3 sensor which is very different to the process here.

Therefore this branch is kept seperate so we can access both versions.
